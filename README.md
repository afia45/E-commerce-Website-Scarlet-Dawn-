# A Fully Functional E-Commerce Website (Scarlet Dawn)

A Fully Functional E-Commerce Website - submitted as a project for the course: **CSE-3532	_Tools and Technologies for Internet Programming_**



## Experimental & Educational Purpose
In the link below, you'd notice I used a lot of different CSS styles, I did it so purely out of curiosity and experimental purposes, anything that felt "cool" I added them to my first ever functional site :D
(P.S. I added all the reference links for these CSS animations at the end)

## ðŸ”— Deployed Website Link (need XAMPP for full experience)
- [E-commerce Website](https://afia45.github.io/E-commerce-Website-Scarlet-Dawn-/index.html)



## Tools and Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- PHP
- MySQL

## Limitations

Not responsive to all devices, for best outcome view in Desktop sized screen

To experience the full functionality of the project, run it locally.

- Clone the project
- Start XAMPP (Apache and MySQL)
- Setup Database
- Run it on any browser 

```bash

## ðŸ”— CSS Animation Inspirations (References)
I found inspiration of CSS background animations from these sites:
- [CSS Background Animations](https://freefrontend.com/css-animated-backgrounds/)
- [CSS Text Glitch Animation](https://freefrontend.com/css-text-glitch-effects/)
- [Card Hover Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-6XRnYHbkw),
I've customized/edited the animations to my taste!
